# Algorithms
This is a generic list of Algorithm Implementations in Java that are recycled from an old notebook from Programming Competitions.

### Mathematics
* Euclid's Greatest Common Divisor
* Least Common Multiple via Euclid's Greatest Common Divisor
* Modular Inverse also using Euclid's Greatest Common Divisor

### Data Structures
* Partition for Union Find and Disjoint Sets
* Prime Sieve based on Erastosthenes Sieve

### Dynamic Programing
* Longest Common Subsequence

### Graphs
* Minimum spanning Tree (Kruskal with Union Find Partition and Java Priority Queue)
* Shortest Path On a Directed Graph (Dijkstra with Java Priority Queue)
